<p align="center"> <em>A HOLISTIC LEARNING APP FOR CHILDREN</em> </p>

_**The app aims to help kids stay active, creative, and inculcate healthy habits using fun activities with a central focus on character development. Rather than the "teach the fish to climb a tree" approach.**_
 <br>
 <br>
 The user can scan through a large selection of Activities to do, Words to learn and Recipes to try and Receive _**Notifications**_ when new content is released

### Activities

### Archives

Archives help the user keep track of their activity on the app:
- Words they have learned.
- Activities they have completed.
- Recipes they have enjoyed.

_Archived words, activities, and recipes are also differentiated in the explore page of each of these interfaces._

<br>

### Quizz

_To aid retention using the principle of spaced repetition._

A randomized quiz of atmost 10 questions is generated from the words added to the user's archive.
Questions are based on the definition of a word and using the word correctly in a sentence.
